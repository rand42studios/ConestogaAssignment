# Assignment 1 Submission
This project is the submission to a previous assignment in the Microsoft Web Technologies course. The repo contains an ASP.NET MVC web application that connects to a database server. Please note that to save cloud computing costs, I've deleted the database backend days after submission so parts of the web app no longer functions. You may set up the database with the SQL script.

## How to install
Download the source code by clicking the "Code" then "Download ZIP" button on the top right of the webpage. Open the Pizza folder, then open Pizza.sln file with Visual Studio. The ASP.NET MVC web application will open. Click the Play icon. The web app will launch at https://localhost:5001/.
